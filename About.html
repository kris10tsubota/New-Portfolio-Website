<h2>
	ABOUT ME
</h2>
	<div class='col-md-8'>	
		<p>Hi there! My name is Kristen, and I am a native Californian currently studying International Relations and Management at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. <br><br>
	
		For those who do not know, art has played a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. In high school, I developed a deep passion for photography and fine art.  While attending Scotland's oldest University, I have further cultivated these skills, with my various involvements in different societies (clubs). During my time here, I have honed my technical skills in design and photography through my various marketing positions on campus. These experiences have helped me discover my love for marketing and advertising. I find it especially enthralling to find new creative ways to spread information or content. <br> <br> For those who do not know, art has played a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember.
